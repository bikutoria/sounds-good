# Sounds Good! 
## About

Electronic music collctor, I have a vast local archive of purchased tracks. For me, these songs are a journey into various chapters of my life. Some are nostalgic, while others make me dream about the future.

This project is a long time vision of mine to create a soundscare to explore and re-discover my personal music archive.

## Getting Started

While this project was built around my personal library, you can reuse the code with minor modifications.

## What I used

I used python to manipulate data, predominantly the following libraries:

* Librosa for audio processing and feature extraction.
* Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
* TinyTag for audio file metadata extraction.
* Pillow for processing album art images.
* Mutagen for a few advanced audio metadata handling.
* Scikit-learn (sklearn) for machine learning, including PCA.
* ANNOY for nearest neighbor search.

## What next?

This is a boilerplate for a future project which I have big ambitions for depending on my personal interests and technical skills. For example, I'd like to have a cemented recommendation logic based on what songs mean to me to queue the next song with zero manual input. 

Stay tuned!
